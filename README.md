# LaTeX Homework Template

## What
This is just a LaTeX file that is good for homeworks where the questions are numbered or given a particular name. It's adopted from templates used by Adam Blank and Shyam Raghavan.

## Installation
Certainly the easiest way to start using this template is to copy the .tex file to you computer and just change the fields you want.

A better way to install this template is to clone this repo to a particular folder on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/latex-hw-template
```

Then, whenever you need to use the template, you can copy the template to wherever you need it. Also, if there are ever any updates, you can simply run

```
git pull
```

to update the template.
